I have solved various python problems, categorizing them neatly into individual directories. Each assignment its own folder with two distinct files:

1. `src`: This folder acts as the primary directory for organizing code files.
2. `utils.py`: This file contains reusable utility functions crafted to tackle specific programming hurdles. These functions are meticulously designed to be modular and maintainable, addressing tasks such as sorting algorithms, string manipulations, and mathematical operations.
3. `driver.py`: Serving as a demonstration, this file showcases the utilization of utility functions from `utils.py`. It includes sample inputs, function invocations, and displays the resulting outcomes.

Additionally, there's a `test` folder housing files associated with each challenge. These files encompass test cases aimed at validating the correctness of utility functions, covering diverse scenarios, edge cases, and expected results.

Here are some notable features:

- **Calendar Module**: Utilizing Python's built-in calendar module for date-related operations, including functionalities like determining the day of the week for a given date.
  
- **Floor, Ceiling, and Rounding**: Employing functions like floor, ceil, and rint from the math module for rounding operations on numerical data.
  
- **Iterables**: Harnessing helper functions from the `iterators_iterables` module to enhance interaction with iterators and iterables in Python, facilitating seamless traversal and manipulation of iterable objects.
  
- **Linear Algebra Operations**: Leveraging the `linear_algebra` module for performing various linear algebraic calculations, such as matrix operations like multiplication and determinant calculation.
  
- **Percentage Calculation**: creating the function to calculate percentages from marks, streamlining grade calculations based on percentage scores.
  
- **Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation**: Employing the `mean_var_std` functions for efficient computation of mean, variance, and standard deviation, effectively handling statistical calculations on datasets.
  
- **String Formatting**: Utilizing convenient string formatting functions available in the `string_format` module to simplify the process of formatting strings with placeholders and variables.
  
- **Text Alignment**: Accessing text alignment functionalities provided by the `text_alignment` module to align text strings according to specified formatting requirements.
  
- **Time Operations**: Employing the `time_delta` module for managing time differences, performing time arithmetic operations, and handling time-related tasks effectively.
  
- **Email Validation**: Ensuring the validity of email addresses using the `validate_mail` function, validating email addresses based on predefined criteria.
  
- **Duplicate Character Removal**: Utilizing the `merge_tool` function to remove duplicate characters from substrings.
  
- **Finding Min and Max Values**: Employing the `min_max` function for efficiently finding minimum and maximum values in datasets.
  
- **Data Structure Modification**: Utilizing the `mutation` module for dynamically modifying data structures.
  
- **Second-Highest Value**: finding the second-highest value in a dataset.
  
- **Matching and Unique Value Retrieval**: Addressing tasks related to matching and retrieving unique values using functions in the `no_idea` file.
  
- **Data Accumulation**: Efficiently accumulating data using the `piling_up` function.
  
- **Word Order**: Implementing functionality for maintaining the order of words.
  
- **Working with Named Tuples**: Utilizing named tuples for structured data storage and manipulation.
